@W: MT462 :|Net myicon_inst.CONTROL0[13] appears to be an unidentified clock source. Assuming default frequency. 
@W: MT531 :|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 0 sequential elements including myvio_inst.U0/I_VIO/GEN_ASYNC_IN\[0\]\.ASYNC_IN_CELL/U_FALLING.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :|Found inferred clock myicon|U0/U_ICON/I_YES_BSCAN_U_BS/iDRCK_LOCAL_inferred_clock which controls 0 sequential elements including myvio_inst.U0/I_VIO/GEN_ASYNC_IN\[0\]\.ASYNC_IN_CELL/S_USER_REG. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.

This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :|Found inferred clock myicon|U0/iUPDATE_OUT_inferred_clock which controls 0 sequential elements including myicon_inst.U0/U_ICON/U_iDATA_CMD.
